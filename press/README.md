## Description

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Chess Edition_ is the eighth edition in the _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ series begun in 2011 and comprising: [Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayancientgreekpunishment/LetsPlayAncientGreekPunishment.html) (2011), [Art Edition Edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayletsplayancientgreekpunishmentarteditionedition/) (2015), [Limited Edition](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/letsplayancientgreekpunishmentlimitededition/) (2016), [CPU Edition](http://pippinbarr.github.io/letsplayancientgreekpunishmentcpuedition/) (2017), [Inversion Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-inversion-edition) (2019), [UI Edition](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-ui-edition) (2019), and [Teaches Typing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-teaches-typing) (2019). In _Chess Edition_ the punishments are remediated as variations on classical chess.

## History

_Chess Edition_ is part of my ongoing idea of essentially spending 2019 making variations on the base _Ancient Greek Punishment_ set of minigames as a way to remain "productive" while in transition to a life with a newborn son (and later not-so-newborn son).

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Chess Edition_ is also another data-point in the ultra-detailed process documentation approach called [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma). So, if you want to, you can read a lot about the game's development by reading its [process documentation](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/blob/master/process/README.md), by going through its [commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/commits/master), and by reading the [research questions](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/blob/master/process/research-questions.md).

## Technology

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Chess Edition_ was created in JavaScript chiefly using [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) and [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/). I used [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) for some manipulation of elements on the page, and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to typeset the mathematical expressions in Zeno.
