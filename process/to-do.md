## General

- ~~Get basic interactive chess board working (chessboard.js)~~
- ~~Get some version of chess.js doing something~~
- ~~Implement [Chess AI](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977)~~
- ~~__YUP. IT CAN BEAT YOU IN 8__ Can this chess beat you in 53 moves?~~
- ~~__UH DUMMY, THEY ARE.__ Consider whether to implement the piece location tables (which aren't in their final example)~~
- ~~Think about how to make this a non-disgusting coding experience (OOP???)~~

- All games need to show PGN throughout

## Sisyphus

- ~~Undo the move right after it's made~~

- Show PGN and undo it
- Think about animation speeds (jQuery.animate() myself? Bleagh.)

## Prometheus

- ~~Remove all white pieces except king and let the game run normally~~

- Handle stalemate in the move calculations (should avoid unless it's the only move?) (IT IS SURPRISINGLY EASY TO MAKE IT STALEMATE YOU. BOO.)

## Zeno

## Tantalus

## Danaids

## Mobile?

- No reason why not? Are those libraries mobile compatible? I think they are?

## Release

## Bugs
