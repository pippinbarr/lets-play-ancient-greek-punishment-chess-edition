## General

- ~~Get basic interactive chess board working (chessboard.js)~~
- ~~Get some version of chess.js doing something~~
- ~~Implement [Chess AI](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977)~~
- ~~__YUP. IT CAN BEAT YOU IN 8__ Can this chess beat you in 53 moves?~~
- ~~__UH DUMMY, THEY ARE.__ Consider whether to implement the piece location tables (which aren't in their final example)~~
- ~~Think about how to make this a non-disgusting coding experience (OOP???)~~

- All games need to show PGN throughout

## Sisyphus

- ~~Undo the move right after it's made~~

- Show PGN and undo it
- Think about animation speeds (jQuery.animate() myself? Bleagh.)

## Prometheus

- ~~Remove all white pieces except king and let the game run normally~~

- Handle stalemate in the move calculations (should avoid unless it's the only move?) (IT IS SURPRISINGLY EASY TO MAKE IT STALEMATE YOU. BOO.)

## Zeno

## Tantalus

- ~~__LET'S TAKE THE EASY ROUTE FOR NOW__ Fix the fact that chess.js seems to break when you play with no kings (perhaps it's to do with attempting to castle? Or otherwise move something involving the king's square? How to fix this? One option is to move ALL pieces off the board and not have any... the other is to actively change chess.js for this project. Yiiikes.)~~
- ~~Show the black pieces off the top of the board~~

- Styling of black pieces isn't great
- How do I feel about this "all the pieces" versus "just the king" approach???

## Danaids

## Mobile?

- No reason why not? Are those libraries mobile compatible? I think they are?

## Release

## Bugs
