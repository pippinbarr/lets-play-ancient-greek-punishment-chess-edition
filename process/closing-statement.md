# _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Chess Edition_ Closing Statement

(__Note__: throughout this text, Iâ€™ll be linking to process materials generated as part of the project in its [code repository](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/blob/master/process/README.md). The links are both to the specific moments I added relevant code to the project and wrote notes about it and also to the process journal I wrote throughout design and development. This approach to process documentation is part of the [Games as Research](https://gamesasresearch.com/) project.)

[_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Chess Edition_](https://pippinbarr.github.io/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/) is the eighth addition to a series of games based on the mythological punishments of Sisypuhs, Prometheus, Tantalus, the Danaids, and (less canonically) Zeno of Elea. In _Chess Edition_ I tried to tell these stories of punishment through the language of chess (and perhaps specifically computer chess).

As the series accumulates, it continues to serve as a way to think through specifics of design: with the core concepts (the myths) set in place, the decisions to be made can be distilled down to the design implications of a particular conceptual take ("what if _you were the boulder_ resisting Sisyphus?") or a specific form (how do I represent these ideas through the language of _chess_?). Chess is particularly satisfying in that it represents an almost platonic understanding of a "game", so translating the myths to chess feels like an ultimate game-designerly activity.

Beyond this kind of highfalutin design stuff, the project also interests me significantly at the level of the underlying technology. I'm using [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js), a JavaScript chess library, and [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/), a JavaScript chessboard, and both naturally have a particular "grain" to how they do their jobs, making some things easier or more "obvious" than others. I find it nice to think about chess.js especially as manifestation of "pure chess" in code form, giving the abstract existence of chess a tangible agency in the project.

In the following, I want to focus in on each of the five sub-games in _Chess Edition_ in order to reflect on specific elements of the design trajectories followed to reach their final form. In keeping with the Games as Research project, a lot of what I'm interested in here is revealing the inner workings of design and development, the mistakes made, the decisions reconsidered, and so on.

## Sisyphus undone

Sisyphus was both the first game I envisaged in chess-form and the easiest to actually implement. From the beginning the idea was to allow the player to make an opening move (say "e4"), only to have the piece fall back to its original position, just as the boulder rolls back down the hill. It feels like a particularly pure representation of the myth and is aided in this computer-chess context by the traditional representation of white as the bottom of a vertical board, lending a sense of "falling back down" to the piece that would be there in other orientations.

__ANIMATED GIF? THEY'RE PRETTY BULKY... DEBULK THEM?__

This variation is important to me in how precisely this myth experience is mirrored in the underlying code using the two chess libraries. Using chess.js the code calls a "move" function to move the piece, then almost immediately called an "undo" function to put it back where it was. Thus this doing and undoing is literally true at the level of code. chessboard.js is similarly cooperative in that it animates the movement of the piece and its undone movement faithfully without any intervention from me (it doesn't care about the frustrating nature of the undone move, just like the gods).

__IMAGE OF CODE__

So, in the end there were few decisions or changes to make here: chess, code, and punishment were in perfect harmony and it was only a matter of "discovering" this through the process of making.

- Tantalus: the story of working out the core visual comedy, and then building toward genuinely interactive comedy, metaphohr
  - Comedy and chess, sight gag (king off board),
  - breaks engine [0a08d10](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/commit/0a08d10ec76cd546afcdca85a014dd221adf6631)

  - -> king off board functional, "Tantalus looks so much better with just the king gone. The joke is much stronger, and there's something terrible and funny about playing chess in this context, knowing  you cannot possibly win and can at best end up capturing every black piece, only to have the king perpetually out of reach."

  - -> tuned physical comedy (king steps off the board as Black's first move, followed by first move) [eda45d2](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/commit/eda45d2eed90bfbef7d20695f4a860a91b8b4014)
  - -> missed opportunity (king steps off the board as Black's first move and it's notated - fix now?!). Breaking the rules of the game and engine led to trouble. Not having a king on the board for one side is a problem in the engine that had to be fixed deep down

- Prometheus: the issue of "feel" in relation to this design process - the original prometheus is my favourite because of the sense of "being done to" it produces, getting the right feel is tricky. Small adjustments make big differences.
  - the issue of the "non-move" - chess.js doesn't allow you to play a move that doesn't affect anything, so you have to fool it into changing the current turn.
  - Design process going from king that can move [ec8423d](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/commit/ec8423da8b8bbd0521dba2c1e412822c7e48f6f5) (concerns about stalemate)
  - -> check=checkmate (king can't move) [2110d10](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/commit/2110d10d54966eb9cbd5a4f77f988f3ee4c44064) [journal](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/blob/master/process/process-journal.md#prometheus-bound)

  - Board set-up as a form of play (Bart and the sociology of chess).
  - Also reflects a specific part of the code itself (board setup is built into board.js). Totally different game-feel and thought process from the others - literally playing a different game. Falling pieces as metaphorical water, a liquid behavior as they "drip" from the board [c356883](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/commit/c35688324f98b3b8d693e84a47b88113ef58795b). [journal](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/blob/master/process/process-journal.md#danaids-overhaul)
  - (Needed custom placement because default is drag-oriented which conflicts with the rest of the game.)
  - Metaphor as a way through the design issues around the abstraction of chess and the "concrete" nature of myth (but perhaps that's the thing: the myths are total metaphors themselves...).

- Zeno: chess notation as a venue to express the core idea (with the board being almost secondary in terms of accurate rendering?)
  - issue of notation perhaps the most interesting here, relationship between algebraic notation and the idea of mathematical notation to reflect an infinite geometric series.
  - Funny that the series actually solves the problem (for infinite steps) but used step by steps is a disaster. This does use the check=checkmate idea. Archimedes as the God in this version (he came up with Geometric series and is using it to punish Zeno which is pretty funny).
  - Issue of PGN particularly when dealing with files (letters) [7c18f8d](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/commit/7c18f8db0161d18b086751a915a3d7dd2eeb04c9),
  - "algebraic" solution [413818d](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/commit/413818dc204bd663f21fa49e5997e806ce8bf9f0) [journal](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-chess-edition/blob/master/process/process-journal.md#the-pgn-of-zeno).
  -  Aside: Conflict with default behaviour of chessboard that uses drag-based movement which wouldn't be possible (need to be able to control the concept of movement through space at the chess level).
