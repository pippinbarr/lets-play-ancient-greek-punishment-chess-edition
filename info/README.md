## Description
*Chess! It already feels like a punishment to so many people! But now even more so! What if Zeus threw chess sets instead of lightning bolts?! What if Archimedes was a vengeful god?! What if you just kept getting chessed for eternity?!*

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Chess Edition_ is yet another new edition in the _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ series, focusing on a retelling of five (kind of) mythological punishments. In _Chess Edition_ each punishment is expressed in the language of chess!
